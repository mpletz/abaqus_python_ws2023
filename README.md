# Abaqus/Python course in the winter term 2022/23

Scripts and resources for the [Abaqus/Python](https://online.unileoben.ac.at/mu_online/pl/ui/$ctx/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=3217352) seminar. The script of the course exists in [pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345680663_Efficient_FE_Modelling_Course_Scripting_Abaqus_CAE_using_Python) and [html](https://www.martinpletz.com/fe-scripting) form. We will go through the crucial steps for automating Abaqus CAE models using Python. Each of the participants will then apply those skills to an example that she/he presents in the final unit.

We decided to meet up on Thursdays from 1 pm to 4 pm ()[dates](https://online.unileoben.ac.at/mu_online/pl/ui/$ctx/wbTvw_List.lehrveranstaltung?pStpSpNr=3217352)). You need a laptop with Abaqus and an editor like Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Spyder on it. Later on, a Python installation including modules like NumPy and matplotlib would be nice, e.g. by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
